PySoundFile
===========

`PySoundFile <https://github.com/bastibe/PySoundFile>`__ is an audio
library based on libsndfile, CFFI and NumPy. Full documentation is
available on http://pysoundfile.readthedocs.org/.

PySoundFile can read and write sound files. File reading/writing is
supported through `libsndfile <http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/>`__,
which is a free, cross-platform, open-source (LGPL) library for reading
and writing many different sampled sound file formats that runs on many
platforms including Windows, OS X, and Unix. It is accessed through
`CFFI <http://cffi.readthedocs.org/>`__, which is a foreign function
interface for Python calling C code. CFFI is supported for CPython 2.6+,
3.x and PyPy 2.0+. PySoundFile represents audio data as NumPy arrays.

Breaking Changes
----------------

PySoundFile has evolved rapidly during the last few releases. Most
notably, we changed the import name from ``import pysoundfile`` to
``import soundfile`` in 0.7. In 0.6, we cleaned up many small
inconsistencies, particularly in the the ordering and naming of
function arguments and the removal of the indexing interface.

In 0.8.0, we changed the default value of ``always_2d`` from ``True``
to ``False``. Also, the order of arguments of the ``write`` function
changed from ``write(data, file, ...)`` to ``write(file, data, ...)``.

Installation
------------

PySoundFile depends on the Python packages CFFI and NumPy, and the
system library libsndfile.

To install the Python dependencies, I recommend using the `Anaconda
<http://continuum.io/downloads>`__ distribution of Python 3. This will
come with all dependencies pre-installed. To install the dependencies
manually, you can use the ``conda`` package manager, which will
install all dependencies using ``conda install cffi numpy`` (conda is
also available independently of Anaconda with ``pip install conda;
conda init``).

With CFFI and NumPy installed, you can use ``pip install pysoundfile``
to download and install the latest release of PySoundFile. On Windows
and OS X, this will also install the library libsndfile. On Linux, you
need to install libsndfile using your distribution's package manager,
for example ``sudo apt-get install libsndfile1``.

Read/Write Functions
--------------------

Data can be written to the file using `soundfile.write()`, or read from
the file using `soundfile.read()`. PySoundFile can open all file formats
that `libsndfile supports
<http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/#Features>`__, for example WAV,
FLAC, OGG and MAT files.

Here is an example for a program that reads a wave file and copies it
into an ogg-vorbis file:

.. code:: python

    import soundfile as sf

    data, samplerate = sf.read('existing_file.wav')
    sf.write('new_file.ogg', data, samplerate)

Block Processing
----------------

Sound files can also be read in short, optionally overlapping blocks
with `soundfile.blocks()`.
For example, this calculates the signal level for each block of a long
file:

.. code:: python

   import numpy as np
   import soundfile as sf

   rms = [np.sqrt(np.mean(block**2)) for block in
          sf.blocks('myfile.wav', blocksize=1024, overlap=512)]

SoundFile Objects
-----------------

Sound files can also be opened as `soundfile.SoundFile` objects. Every
SoundFile has a specific sample rate, data format and a set number of
channels.

If a file is opened, it is kept open for as long as the SoundFile
object exists. The file closes when the object is garbage collected,
but you should use the `soundfile.SoundFile.close()` method or the
context manager to close the file explicitly:

.. code:: python

   import soundfile as sf

   with sf.SoundFile('myfile.wav', 'rw') as f:
       while f.tell() < len(f):
           pos = f.tell()
           data = f.read(1024)
           f.seek(pos)
           f.write(data*2)

All data access uses frames as index. A frame is one discrete time-step
in the sound file. Every frame contains as many samples as there are
channels in the file.

RAW Files
---------

Pysoundfile can usually auto-detect the file type of sound files. This
is not possible for RAW files, though:

.. code:: python

   import soundfile as sf

   data, samplerate = sf.read('myfile.raw', channels=1, samplerate=44100,
                              subtype='FLOAT')

Note that on x86, this defaults to ``endian='LITTLE'``. If you are
reading big endian data (mostly old PowerPC/6800-based files), you
have to set ``endian='BIG'`` accordingly.

You can write RAW files in a similar way, but be advised that in most
cases, a more expressive format is better and should be used instead.

Virtual IO
----------

If you have an open file-like object, Pysoundfile can open it just like
regular files:

.. code:: python

    import soundfile as sf
    with open('filename.flac', 'rb') as f:
        data, samplerate = sf.read(f)

Here is an example using an HTTP request:

.. code:: python

    import io
    import soundfile as sf
    from urllib.request import urlopen

    url = "http://tinyurl.com/shepard-risset"
    data, samplerate = sf.read(io.BytesIO(urlopen(url).read()))

Note that the above example only works with Python 3.x.
For Python 2.x support, replace the third line with:

.. code:: python

    from urllib2 import urlopen
